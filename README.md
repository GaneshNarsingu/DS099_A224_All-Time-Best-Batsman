This repository was created by Ganesh. All teammates were added as collaborators,and the All-Time-Best-Batsman IPL dataset was uploaded as the main data source


Project Overview (Eshan’s Contribution)

This repository contains our group project for the module 7COM1079 – Team Research and Development.
My contribution focuses on the Introduction, Dataset description, and the Research Question.

I added an R script that:

loads the IPL batsman dataset

previews the first rows

prints the structure

provides summary statistics

This information was used to describe the dataset clearly in the report and to justify our research question:

“Is there a statistically significant correlation between the number of innings played and the total runs scored by IPL batsmen?”
